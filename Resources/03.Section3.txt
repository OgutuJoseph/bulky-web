Section 3: Razor Project


54. Create Razor Project
• In Bulky >> 
    -> Right Click Solution >> Add Project
    -> Template :: [search 'Razor'] ASP.NET Core Web App !!Different from MVC!!
    -> Select Project Dir >> Project Name [BulkyWeb] >> Solution Name [Bulky]
        :: Leave 'Place solution and project in same directory' unchecked
    -> Framework :: .NET 6.0 (Long Term Support)



55. What's Different in Razor Project?
• 



56. Setup EF Core
• Basic steps for project setup
    -> Set up Nuget Packages (copy from other project, two options available)
        ^ Option 1: Nuget Package Manager >> check appropriate project >> install
        ^ Option 2: Edit csproj file
    -> Create Model [Models]
    -> Create ApplicationDbContext [Data]
    -> Update Program.cs
    -> Run migrations (1. add-migration, 2. update-database)




57. Create first Razor Page
• Two approaches
    
    [If you know in model we have the same name, but you will repeat 'using' statements multiple times]
    -> 1. Create folder 'Category' in [Pages]
        - Create each file i.e., Index, Create, Update etc.

    [you don't have to be explicit, *i.e., don't have to make multiple declarations]
    -> 2. Create folder 'Categories' in [Pages]
        - Create each file i.e., Index, Create, Update etc.



58. Display all Categories
• 



59. Create Category UI
• 



60. Create Category Post Handler
• [BindProperty] -> inside `public class CreateModel` or [BindProperties] -> outside `public class CreateModel`
    ^ Used to bind properties defined in page model



61. Edit and Delete Category
• [BindProperty] -> inside `public class CreateModel` or [BindProperties] -> outside `public class CreateModel`
    ^ Used to bind properties defined in page model
    ^ Enables you to pass Id of object so that you don't run into the error below:
        -> 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object.'


62. Toastr Notifications and Partial Views
• No need for below in _Notification.cshtml
    ->
        @page
        @model BulkyWebRazor_Temp.Pages.Shared._NotificationModel
        @{
        }

    -> Similarly, you can discard _Notification.cshtml.cs
