107. Details Action Method
- When in the same area, as opposed to using href on an anchor tag, you can as well use `asp-action` tag-helper and define the controller method.
    I.e., -> asp-action="Details"

    ^ Following above, depending on how you've passed the param in the controller method, the parameter value must match the `asp-route-__` tag-helper.
    I.e.,   -> if method is public IActionResult Details (int id)
                :: tag-helper must be `asp-route-id`
            -> if method is public IActionResult Details (int productId)
                :: tag-helper must be `asp-route-productId`
        



108. Details UI
- Whatever you pass in the method as model is the one that should be defined in the View
    I.e.,
        -> if it's IEnumerable<Product> 
            view (Index) will be `@model IEnumerable<Product>`
         -> if it's Product
            view (Details) will be `@model Product`
